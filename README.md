# Obesity Classification App

A Streamlit web application that predicts an individualâ€™s **obesity level** based on personal, lifestyle, and physical condition data such as diet habits, daily activity, and transportation mode.  
This project was developed as part of my **Model Deployment course assignment** at **BINUS University**.  
The backend model was trained using **XGBoost**, with complete preprocessing, encoding, and deployment pipeline.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict **obesity categories** (e.g., Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on user-provided input.  
The overall workflow includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ handling categorical features, scaling, and feature transformation.  
2. **Feature Encoding** â€“ applying:
   - Label encoding for binary categories  
   - Ordinal encoding for ordered categories (e.g., CAEC, CALC)  
   - One-hot encoding for transportation modes  
3. **Model Training** â€“ using **XGBoost Classifier** for multi-class classification.  
4. **Model Evaluation** â€“ testing model performance on accuracy and classification metrics.  
5. **Model Deployment** â€“ deploying the model using **Streamlit**, loading the `.pkl` model, and visualizing predictions interactively.
